                    <p>No matter if I am coding video games, playing them, or building lego robots,
                    I am always using technology and computers. This has eventually led me to my
                    dream career of computer engineering. To achieve this goal,
                    I plan on first taking the engineering courses offered by 
                    my high school which will surround myself with practice for my career. 
                    Then, I hope to join the engineering academy and also  
                    attend a well-known engineering college such as MIT to strenthen my career path
                    of computer engineering. 
                    I have observed that in the world of computer engineering, the 
                    imperative qualities required to be successful are being
                    innovative, creative and unique, and also motivated to try different options. 
                    I have noticed many of the same personality traits in myself also. Sports have also played a huge role in
                    letting me explore and find out what I enjoy doing. I have been working hard
                    playing soccer for 4 years and now I am trying out for the high school team.
                    The major accomplishments that I have achieved
                    throughout my life also highlight my traits. My most memorable 
                    accomplishment was getting first place in our middle school robotics tournament and
                    being on the front page of the school's website.</p>
